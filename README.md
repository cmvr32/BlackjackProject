## Blackjack Project

### Week 4 homework for Skill Distillery.

## Overview: Blackjack

Create a functional command line blackjack game. Implement methods in classes that mimic the functionality of a game of blackjack. Decks need to be able to be shuffled, as well as be able to deal and remove cards. Hands need to be able to add cards, calculate their current value (in accordance to the rules of blackjack), and display themselves.


## Technologies/Skills Used

Project learning objectives:

* Getting comfortable building classes in an Object-Oriented manner.
* Building classes whose fields are Objects.
* Practice writing methods.
* Use collection types to organize and manage data.
* Use conditionals to create game logic.


* Java
* Eclipse
* Git

## Lessons Learned

During this assignment I built upon my limited understanding of how to build classes such as the class hand, built to function for any card game, into the specific hand of the player and dealer that operates according to the specific blackjack rules. I feel far more confident in my ability to to build classes whose fields are objects, write methods to perform functions beyond printing a menu, and the relationship between the main project application and project entities.

Technically I learned about the concept of Recursion in java. To allow the player to chose to play another game I called the main project application within the gameplay method and the main application calls the gameplay method. This caused the game to create a new application and start a new game without properly ending the game prior. When the player was done playing and chose to quit, the game they were in was exited but they were then brought back to the game prior. 

Personally I learned that while I still need a lot of help, I am beginning to understand on a basic level what I want to use in order to accomplish a specific task within the projects. Making it easier for me to ask for specific guidance rather then a more broad 'help I am stuck'. I also learned how to play Blackjack!
